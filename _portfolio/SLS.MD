# Powder Printing
Powder printing is a form of 3D printing that uses powder polymers and a laser to melt the particles to form a durable product. This type of additive manufacturing is valuable for the support-free prints, strong mechanical properties of its prints, multiple parts being printed at once, and availability for efficiency to make this technology the quickest printing option. The printer has a bed with the powder at a lower heated temperature to which a laser scans across to make the powder melt into the desired geometry. After each scan, the bed moves down and another thin layer of powder will be spread for the laser to melt. This type of printing allows for materials with viable mechanical properties, e.g. chemical resistance, stiffness, strength, and high melting points. Overall, this type of manufacturing formulates dense parts with advantageous mechanical properties while needing no supports and being efficient with print placement in the build volume. 

# Generative Design
Generative Design is a process that uses specified geometries, their purpose, and the theoretical impacts the product will experience to create a design that fits all the requirements inputted. This design tactic makes it so that a designer with constraints on a product can use this AI-powered tool to create the part quicker and the output could be something they wouldnâ€™t have thought of in the first place. Generative design can also be used to optimize parts that have already been designed so that they can be lighter, stronger, or have a better printing process.

# How can these work together?
Combining these two aspects of manufacturing is perfect for applications in the automobile industry. Implementing powder printing and generative design into this industry could help with waste production, cost of parts, and efficiency of parts used. mSLS is another option for powder printing, powder printing using metal powders. The ability to powder print metal materials is where the automobile industry can take advantage of this type of manufacturing. mSLS can create products already used in current vehicles and can decrease waste and increase productivity by recycling powder and having batches of prints going at the same time. Combining this with generative design opens a gateway into innovative parts and processes for how vehicles are made. Generative design can be used to optimize parts for future vehicles to make them lightweight, increasing the efficiency of the car overall. Another way this could be helpful is for replacing parts if only a portion of a major mechanism is malfunctioning, instead of having to get a whole new part, printing just the portion that is broken would be cost-effective for the owner of the car or the seller if they obtained a car to sell that does not run correctly. Furthermore, future cars could also be designed differently if designed with generative design. We as humans get easily stuck in the bounds of what has already been created and try to find another way to accomplish the same goals, AI however, does not have these same mindset bounds and can reach out beyond the scope of what has already been created, and based on purely the end goal in mind, design a product that has the potential to spark a new way of thinking into the minds of those take advantage of it.
