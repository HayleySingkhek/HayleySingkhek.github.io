Powder printing is a form of 3D printing that uses powder polymers and a laser to melt the particles to form a durable product. This type of additive manufacturing is valuable for the support-free prints, strong mechanical properties of its prints, multiple parts being printed at once, and availability for efficiency to make this technology the quickest printing option. The printer has a bed with the powder at a lower heated temperature to which a laser scans across to make the powder melt into the desired geometry. After each scan, the bed moves down and another thin layer of powder will be spread for the laser to melt. This type of printing allows for materials with viable mechanical properties, e.g. chemical resistance, stiffness, strength, and high melting points. Overall, this type of manufacturing formulates dense parts with advantageous mechanical properties while needing no supports and being efficient with print placement in the build volume. 

Generative Design is a process that uses specified geometries, their purpose, and the theoretical impacts the product will experience to create a design that fits all the requirements inputted. This design tactic makes it so that a designer with constraints on a product can use this AI-powered tool to create the part quicker and the output could be something they wouldnâ€™t have thought of in the first place. Generative design can also be used to optimize parts that have already been designed so that they can be lighter, stronger, or have a better printing process.

	Combining these two aspects of manufacturing is perfect for applications in the automobile industry. Implementing powder printing and generative design into this industry could help with waste production, cost of parts, and efficiency of parts used.
