# Product Design
Top-down modeling is a process of prototyping where a multi-component product is fully created in one file where all of the parts are referenced as being a part of the same parent component. This provides the designer multiple advantages, e.g., being able to use one parameter for all parts, being able to easily create the next component in relation to the already created ones, and eliminating the hassle of moving each individual part to a file where the final product is then assembled. For this assignment in particular, the top-down modeling was most helpful when visualizing the orientation factor of the bike phone holder and the connecting point between that factor and the part that secures around the handlebar. Being able to attach one of the halves that would wrap around the handle to the rest of the phone holder with a joint eliminated an additional fastener being added, increasing the risk of the phone holder. The design was made with beginner CAD enthusiasts in mind. As someone who enjoys the process of creating my own projects, I also remember what it was like starting out with CAD and how even making a cube with a hole seemed like a daunting task. A bike phone holder that allows for the phone orientation to change is a product that can be used for all ages as the only requirement for need is a cellular device and something with a cylindrical bar. The design is made so that it can be remade easily by beginner or non-beginner CAD users. For younger users, instead of using heat inserts, they could use rubber bands, or super glue for a more permanent positioning of the holder around the handlebar. Meanwhile, more experienced users can use the bolts and heat inserts. The material chosen was ABS due to its durability, feasibility of access, and lower cost. ABS is desirable for injection molding due to its low melting temperature, meaning this product could be mass-produced easily compared to having to use a filament printer for each part. Its ability to undergo physical forces without harming the product makes this material a great candidate for being used in an active environment. 


# Assembly 
To assemble the bike phone holder, use a soldering iron and add 2 5M heat inserts- one for the top and the other for the bottom hole. After applying the heat inserts, Place the two halves around the chosen handlebar and screw a 30 mm 5M bolt through the top and bottom of the apparatus surrounding the handlebar. Insert the phone into the phone holder and then align the cross protrusion for the wanted orientation of the cellular device. Use the additional stabilizer and place it so that it fits into the groove under the cross apparatus and sits above the top of the holder.
